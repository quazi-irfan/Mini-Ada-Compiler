# Mini-Ada to x86 Compiler
This is a mini-Ada to x86 compiler. Our compiled program will run on 16 bit architecture(i.e. Intel 8086/8088).
Our version of Ada supports only integer and string(limited) data type, and allows assignment and IO statement. 
It supports expressions, with addition, multiplication and unary negation operator, in an assignment statement,
If all operators have same precedence in an expression, it uses right to left associativity.
In an IO statement, it supports integer input/output, and string output.

## Backend
We have to run the following command to compile our compiler,
```bash
javac adac.java
```
Now our compiler is ready to compile ada source file.

Example Hello.ada file contains,
```Ada
-- Ada Hello World Program
procedure main is
begin
  putln("Hello World");
end main;
```

To compile Hello.ada we have to run the following command,
```bash
$ java adac Hello.ada
Parsing successful. Output at Hello.tac
TAC to x86 translation sucessful. Output at Hello.asm
```

Our compiler would would create Hello.tac and Hello.asm file. Hello.TAC
([Three Address Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-address_code)) file contains our intermediate representation, 
and Hello.ASM contains the MASM style x86 assembly instructions. 

Contant of the Hello.TAC file,
```
PROC    _MAIN   
wrs     _s0     
wrln    
ENDP    _MAIN   
START   PROC    _MAIN   
```
Contant of the Hello.ASM file,
```asm
	.model small
	.586
	.stack 100h
	.data
_s0    db      "Hello World","$"
	.code
	include io.asm

	  ;PROC    _MAIN   
_MAIN	proc
	  push bp
	  mov bp, sp
	  sub sp, 0

	  ;wrs     _s0     
	  mov dx, offset _s0
	  call writestr

	  ;wrln    
	  call writeln

	  ;ENDP    _MAIN   
	  add sp, 0
	  pop bp
	  ret 0
_MAIN	ENDP

	  ;START   PROC    _MAIN   
main	PROC
	  mov ax, @data
	  mov ds, ax
	  call _MAIN
	  mov ah, 4ch
	  int 21h
main	ENDP
	  END main

```
(Note: that all user defined identifiers has an underscore prefix added to them in both TAC and ASM file.)

## Frontend
Now we will use Microsoft Macro Assembler [MASM32](http://www.masm32.com) to translate our x86 instructions to object code. The files `ml.exe` and `link16.exe` are found under `<masm32>/bin`

Since [IO.asm](https://github.com/iamcreasy/Mini-Ada-Compiler/blob/master/io.asm) contains the IO macros we will need copy IO.asm in the same direcoty as Hello.ASM

The following command to translate our x86 instruction to machine code will create `Hello.obj`
```
ml /c Hello.asm
```

The following intruction to statically link the content of IO.ASM with Hello.OBJ will create final 16bit executable file `Hello.exe`
```
link16 Hello.obj;
```

## Running the executable
Since Hello.exe is 16 bit application, we will use [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com) to emulate a sandboxed 16 bit environment.

Copy the file to Dosbox directory, and run the file. We will see the following output,
```
C:\>hello.exe
Hello World
```

## Example 1 : Prints the result of an expression
TwoNum.ada contains,
```Ada
-- Print the result of adding 1 and 2
